  Iterative learning might remind <br>you of <br><br>the "Hot and Cold" kid's game for finding a hidden object like a thimble. In this game, the "hidden object" is the best possible model. You'll start with a wild guess ("The value of  is 0.") and wait for the system to tell you what the loss is. Then, you'll try another guess ("The value of  is 0.5.") and see what the loss is. Aah, you're getting warmer. Actually, if you play this game right, you'll usually be getting warmer. The real trick to the game is <p>trying to find <p>the best possible model as efficiently as possible.
